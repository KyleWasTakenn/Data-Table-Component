----- TODO // NOTES -----

- Fix styling on hover for title items (Background color changes).
    + Fixed by using h1 element instead of body element.

- Animation feedback for credential copying.
    + BG or no BG for credential buttons?
        ++ If BG, work on a fade-in animation on-hover.


- Delete option for selected entries.
    + Will require either deleting the mock data permanently, or creating a mock backend DB for testing.
        ++ For now just make a delete button pop up when selecting accounts, + make a confirmation modal 

- Modal popup for editing existing account info.
    + Added edit option in menu button, no functionality yet.

- Resizable table columns


List of components needed so far:
- Edit info modal.
- Confirmation modal for deleting account info.
